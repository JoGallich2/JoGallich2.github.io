<body>

    My name is Joseph Gallichio and I am currently a Junior here at Mizzou. 
    I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology. 
    I do not have any previous web application or development experience. 
    My expectations for this course are to add the skill to working with html as well as being able to create my own website with my own creativity. 
    I would like to use the information I learn in this class for both personal everyday life as well as for work in the possible future. 
    I think my favorite hobby would have to be either golf or gaming but since it is winter I will go with gaming. 
    In my free time I participate in club esports and am actually a captain for one of the teams.
