                    <h3 class = projects-header3>  Minus Malus: Brain Game - Midterm Project for Game Development</h3>
                    <p> 
                        A brain training game that enhances cognitive skills like processing speed, working
                        memory, and cognitive flexibility. This game is inspired by Cognifit's Minus Malus game. The player controls a
                        cannon and uses the 1, 2, and 3 numbers button to shoot a cannon of the corresponding value. The goal of the game is
                        to reduce floating down crates number value from the specific number 1-10 down to 0. There is a set number of crates
                        that will spawn as well as a set number of each type of cannonball. If the user goes below 0 when reducing the
                        crates number they get subtracted points, or If the create falls below the screen the user also gets subtracted
                        points. When a crate is successfully brought to 0 the user gets points. There are three progressively challenging
                        levels with varying numbers on the crates, different spawn quantities, as well as speeds at which the crate falls.

                    <h3 class = projects-header3> Bee Balloon: Brain Game - Final Project for Game Development </h3>
                    <p> 
                        A cognitive training game designed to enhance reaction time, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills, inspired
                        by Cognifit’s Bee Balloon game. The player controls a bee, navigating through predefined paths to pop balloons while
                        avoiding hazards such as red zones and bombs. The game consists of four progressively challenging levels,
                        integrating interpolation, easing, and Bezier curve-based movement to create smooth and engaging gameplay. A key
                        focus of the project is data collection, recording player performance metrics like game duration, score, and
                        feedback for potential research use. The game includes a pause system, an end-game scene displaying final results,
                        and a structured UI that presents real-time stats such as score, time, and remaining lives.

                <h2 class = projects-header2> Compiler Design & Parsing Techniques </h2>
                <h3 class = projects-header3> Python Parser ( ANTLR - Based ) </h3>
                    <p>
                        The Python Parser is a group-based project that implements a lexical and syntax analyzer for Python 3.x, developed
                        using ANTLR. This project centers around constructing a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to parse essential elements of
                        Python code and generate a parse tree for visualization. The parser is designed to handle arithmetic operations,
                        assignment statements, conditional expressions, and looping constructs, ensuring correct syntax analysis while
                        preserving Python’s indentation sensitivity. To achieve this, the project was broken down into three deliverables:
                        parsing arithmetic and assignment operators, handling conditionals and logical operators, and supporting loops and
                        nested structures. The parser was thoroughly tested using predefined Python code samples to ensure accurate parsing
                        and correct behavior. Additionally, a README.md file on the GitHub repository provides detailed information about
                        the setup, usage instructions, and project requirements. This parser lays the groundwork for future enhancements,
                        such as parsing functions and classes, and provides valuable insights into compiler design and syntax analysis
                        techniques.
