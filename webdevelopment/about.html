    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
        My name is <strong>Joseph Gallichio</strong>, a junior at the University of 
        Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou), where I am pursuing a <em>Bachelor of Science</em> in Computer Science 
        with a minor in Information Technology. I am also working toward certifications in 
        <em>Cybersecurity</em> and Information Systems and Technology to broaden my expertise. <br><br>

        Outside of academics, I serve as the Competitions Manager for the Rocket League esports club at Mizzou. 
        In this role, I lead the Gold Team to national competitions, including NACE and NECC, and help coordinate 
        tournaments and team strategies. Through my involvement in esports, I have developed strong leadership, 
        teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Along with that, my team and I have reached a rank of top 0.2% of players globally. 
        My work in esports has taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and clear communication. <br><br>

        I have hands-on experience with C++, Python, Java, and SQL, which I apply to my academic projects and personal 
        endeavors. I am also passionate about building custom PCs, as it allows me to combine my love for technology and 
        hands-on problem-solving. As I continue my education, I am eager to deepen my technical skills and make meaningful 
        contributions in both technology and esports. I always make sure to approach challenges in coding, gaming, and teamwork 
        with curiosity and determination.
