                <p>
                    My name is <strong>Joseph Gallichio</strong>, a junior at the University of
                    Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou), where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
                    with a minor in Information Technology. I am also working toward certifications in
                    <em>Cybersecurity</em> and <em>Information Systems and Technology</em> to broaden my expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I serve as the Competitions Manager for the Rocket League esports club at
                    Mizzou.
                    In
                    this role, I lead the Gold Team to national competitions, including NACE and NECC, and help
                    coordinate
                    tournaments and team strategies. Through my involvement in esports, I have developed strong
                    leadership,
                    teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Along with that, my team and I have reached a rank of top 0.2%
                    of
                    players globally. My work in esports has taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and
                    clear
                    communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have hands-on experience with C++, Python, Java, and SQL, which I apply to my academic projects
                    and
                    personal endeavors. I am also passionate about building custom PCs, as it allows me to combine my
                    love
                    for
                    technology and hands-on problem-solving. As I continue my education, I am eager to deepen my
                    technical
                    skills and make meaningful contributions in both technology and esports. I always make sure to
                    approach
                    challenges in coding, gaming, and teamwork with curiosity and determination.
