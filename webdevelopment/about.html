    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <main>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Joseph Gallichio</strong>, a junior at the University of
            Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou), where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
            with a minor in Information Technology. I am also working toward certifications in
            <em>Cybersecurity</em> and <em>Information Systems and Technology</em> to broaden my expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I serve as the Competitions Manager for the Rocket League esports club at Mizzou. In
            this role, I lead the Gold Team to national competitions, including NACE and NECC, and help coordinate
            tournaments and team strategies. Through my involvement in esports, I have developed strong leadership,
            teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Along with that, my team and I have reached a rank of top 0.2% of
            players globally. My work in esports has taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and clear
            communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have hands-on experience with C++, Python, Java, and SQL, which I apply to my academic projects and
            personal endeavors. I am also passionate about building custom PCs, as it allows me to combine my love for
            technology and hands-on problem-solving. As I continue my education, I am eager to deepen my technical
            skills and make meaningful contributions in both technology and esports. I always make sure to approach
            challenges in coding, gaming, and teamwork with curiosity and determination.
