    My name is Joseph Gallichio, and I’m currently a junior here at Mizzou.
    I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology. 
    Although I don't have prior experience in web application development, I’m eager to gain skills in working with HTML.
    I hope to apply what I learn in this course for personal projects and potential future career opportunities.
    As for my hobbies, I would say my favorites are either golf or gaming, though since it's winter, I’ll lean toward gaming. 
    In my free time, I also participate in club esports, and I’m proud to serve as the captain of club gold team.
