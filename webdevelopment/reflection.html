                    As a Computer Science major at the University of Missouri-Columbia, my academic journey has been created
                    by
                    a broad list of courses that provide me with a foundation in technology, engineering, and communication.
                    Through my classes, I have gained knowledge in algorithms, game development, artificial intelligence,
                    and
                    cybersecurity. All of these courses have greatly increased my passion for both coding and
                    problem-solving.
                    My experiences in classes like Algorithm Design and Game Development have sharpened my skills. My
                    participation in the Rocket League Esports Club has taught me how valuable teamwork, leadership, and
                    strategic thinking is.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    As I am approaching my senior year, I am focused on building real-world experience through internships
                    and
                    industry opportunities. I am actively seeking internships in software engineering, information
                    technology,
                    cybersecurity, and game development, aiming to apply the skills I've perfected throughout my academic
                    journey. These experiences will not only help improve my expertise but also will allow me to contribute
                    to
                    more impactful projects within these fields. I am excited to work alongside professionals who can
                    challenge
                    me to think more creatively, while also helping bridge the gap between my academic foundation and the
                    requirements of the industry.

                <p class="reflection">
                    In addition to my academic and professional growth, my involvement in the Mizzou Rocket League Esports
                    Club
                    will continue to play a central role in my senior year. As Competition Manager and Captain of the Gold
                    Team,
                    I am committed to fostering teamwork, leadership, and strategic improvement. The club will serve as both
                    a
                    platform for improving my leadership skills and a source of inspiration for improvement in both my
                    academic
                    work and future career. My long-term goal is to not only excel in the aspects of my career but also to
                    give back to the community, potentially teaching the next generation of leaders within the club.

                    Looking forward to my career goals, I am applying what I have learned to tackle complex challenges in
                    software engineering and cybersecurity. I am also excited to continue exploring the combination of game
                    development and artificial intelligence, areas where I hope that I can contribute to innovations on both
                    ends. Ultimately, my career goals revolve around blending my passion for technology, gaming, and
                    cybersecurity to create a meaningful impact in our society. Whether as a software engineer,
                    cybersecurity
                    expert, or game developer, I strive to continue growing both personally and professionally, with the
                    ultimate goal of contributing to advancements in the field and potentially mentoring the next generation
                    of tech innovators.
