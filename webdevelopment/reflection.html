                As a Computer Science major at the University of Missouri-Columbia, my academic journey has been created
                by
                a broad list of courses that provide me with a foundation in technology, engineering, and communication.
                Through my classes, I have gained knowledge in algorithms, game development, artificial intelligence,
                and
                cybersecurity. All of these courses have greatly increased my passion for both coding and
                problem-solving.
                My experiences in classes like Algorithm Design and Game Development have sharpened my skills. My
                participation in the Rocket League Esports Club has taught me how valuable teamwork, leadership, and
                strategic thinking is.

            <p class="reflection">
                As I am approaching my senior year, I am focused on building real-world experience through internships
                and
                industry opportunities. I am actively seeking internships in software engineering, information
                technology,
                cybersecurity, and game development, aiming to apply the skills I've perfected throughout my academic
                journey. These experiences will not only help improve my expertise but also will allow me to contribute
                to
                more impactful projects within these fields. I am excited to work alongside professionals who can
                challenge
                me to think more creatively, while also helping bridge the gap between my academic foundation and the
                requirements of the industry.

                In addition to my academic and professional growth, my involvement in the Mizzou Rocket League Esports
                Club
                will continue to play a central role in my senior year. As Competition Manager and Captain of the Gold
                Team,
                I am committed to fostering teamwork, leadership, and strategic improvement. The club will serve as both
                a
                platform for improving my leadership skills and a source of inspiration for improvement in both my
                academic
                work and future career. My long-term goal is to not only excel in the aspects of my career but also to
                give
                back to the community, potentially teaching the next generation of leaders within the club.
                Looking forward to my career goals, I am applying what I have learned to tackle complex challenges in
                software engineering and cybersecurity. I am also excited to continue exploring the combination of game
                development and artificial intelligence, areas where I hope that I can contribute to innovations on both
                ends. Ultimately, my career goals revolve around blending my passion for technology, gaming, and
                cybersecurity to create a meaningful impact in our society. Whether as a software engineer,
                cybersecurity
                expert, or game developer, I strive to continue growing both personally and professionally, with the
                ultimate goal of contributing to advancements in the field and potentially mentoring the next generation
                of
                tech innovators.
